# EvangelicalMagazineTheme
Custom WordPress theme for the [Evangelical Magazine website](https://www.evangelicalmagazine.com/) and is provided here as a help to other developers who are creating WordPress sites for print magazines. This responsive theme requires a [helper plugin](https://github.com/markbarnes/EvangelicalMagazinePlugin), and the [Genesis Framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/).

## Support
No support is offered for this theme. It was not created with distribution in mind, has no user-configurable options and is unlikely to work out of the box in another context. It's published here purely as a help to other developers (particularly those working for non-profits) who need something similar and want to minimize development time.
